# Feature base fusion for splicing forgery detection based on neuro fuzzy
These are the  Matlab codes used for my master thesis as well as the paper "Feature base fusion for splicing forgery detection based on Neuro fuzzy".
You can download the database "Columbia Image Splicing Detection Evaluation Dataset" in order to use the codes and produce the results.

We also appricate if you add the text bellow to your manuscripts in the case you use the codes:

# We sincerely appreciate The authors of paper "Feature base fusion for splicing forgery detection based on neuro fuzzy" for providing the codes for academic applications.
