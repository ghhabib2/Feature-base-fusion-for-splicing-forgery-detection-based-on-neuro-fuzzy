# Feature base fusion for splicing forgery detection based on neuro fuzzy
These are the  Matlab codes used for my master thesis as well as the paper "Feature base fusion for splicing forgery detection based on Neuro fuzzy" which is going to publish in the coming months.
All the codes written in Matlab. You can download the database "Columbia Image Splicing Detection Evaluation Dataset" in order to use the codes and produce the results.
